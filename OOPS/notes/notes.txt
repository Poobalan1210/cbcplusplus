4 default methods available with every class

Constructor :
Constructor name is same as the class name, gets called automatically when we create an object

Copy Constructor : Create a copy of the given object of the same type.
It exists by default, we don't need to write it.

Copy Assignment Operator : will make two objects equal

Destructor :
Default destructor is called when :
1. when object is static : Destructor is called when the object goes out of scope
2. when object is dynamic : when the user uses 'delete'

Constant data members : you cannot change them
Constant Functions : Do not update data members of a class
Constant parameters : you don't need yo update it
