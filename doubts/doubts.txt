int arr[5];
how to assign &arr to a variable
how to find sizeof an array in c++
what happens at compile time and runtime for arrays? When is the size allocated?

can i do something like int a[m] = fun(); where this function returns an array but the size is not known? size can be more than m.

char c[] = “hey”;	// why dont we provide size here? 
cout << c; 
cout << *c;

what is (void *)
intblockpointer = (int*)malloc(1000 * sizeof(int));	??

const char * ch = "heyy";	// ??
cout << ch;
cout << *ch;

double d = 5.0;
cout << d; // 5 ? why?

long vs long int vs long long vs long long int :  
size : Whats the difference if same size 8 bytes?
datatype : long int gave l and long long int gave x ?? 

int n;
cin >> n;
int arr[n] = {0,2,3,4,5,6};	// why error?
cout << arr[6];
