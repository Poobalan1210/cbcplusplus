double d = 5.0;
cout << d; // 5 ? why?

long vs long int vs long long vs long long int :  
size : Whats the difference if same size 8 bytes?
datatype : long int gave l and long long int gave x ?? 

int c[] = {6, 7, 8, 9};
int *b = c;
// can i do it like int *b = {1,2,3,4};	NO


cout << (void *)&ch; // meaning? it is telling compiler that it does not know that the address contains type char, this is how we can stop << from converting the address into char automatically

cin >> *(arr + i);
is this same as : ??
cin >> arr[i];

Car(Car x) {	// why error?
    name = x.name;
    price = x.price;
    model = x.model;
  }

How to do this? // Something like Generators in Java?
stack<Human> s;
vector<Human> v;
